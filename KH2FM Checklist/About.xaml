                This program tracks various items, provides a space for the user to take notes, 
                and provides a list of checks in the game. <LineBreak/>

                Tracker <LineBreak/>
                Left click checks an item and increments a counter. <LineBreak/>
                Right click unchecks an item and decrements a counter. <LineBreak/>
                Some worlds have a keyhole next to them. Left clicking on the keyhole will mark a visit.
                Right click will unmark it. <LineBreak/>

                Checklist <LineBreak/>
                The list is mostly in order of when the player will encounter them in the game. <LineBreak/>
                All chests are listed for each world except the chests found in the Garden of Assemblage. <LineBreak/>
                Some checks are combined (Ex: Final popups for a world) <LineBreak/>
                There's a Mickey symbol next to each check which can be toggled to mark checks of significance.
                Left and right click cycles it through a gold Mickey, ability icon, magic, and a keyblade. <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                
                The list does not include leveling or form leveling. It also skips over some bonus modifier checks.<LineBreak/>
